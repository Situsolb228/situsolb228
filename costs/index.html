            <p>The Knight Foundation <a href="/about/">paid for PANDA</a> so you don&rsquo;t have to. It&rsquo;s 100% free and open-source software. To get one for your newsroom, you&rsquo;ll need a server to host the site and store your data.</p>
            
            <h2>The easy way</h2>
            <p>For less than $45 per month ($540 per year), you can run PANDA on a server in Amazon&rsquo;s cloud. Even better, you can pre-pay, which would bring your cost down to less than $300 per year.</p>
            <p>(Specifically, we recommend a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#on-demand">&ldquo;small&rdquo; instance</a> on Amazon’s EC2. If you reserve your server, we recommend the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#heavyUtilizationRI">heavy-utilization small instance</a>. PANDA is packaged as an AMI, so it&rsquo;s just a couple of clicks to fire one up.)</p>

            <h2>Do it yourself</h2>
            <p>You can run PANDA on any server — in the cloud, your data center, or under your desk. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to set up if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
            <p>See <a href="http://panda.readthedocs.org/en/latest/production.html">the PANDA administrator documentation</a> for specific details on how to set up a PANDA on Amazon (easy!) or on your own server (show off!).</p>
