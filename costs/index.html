        PANDA project is free software, but you’ll need your own server.

        <h2>The easy way</h2>
        <p>For less than $45 per month ($540 per year), you can run PANDA on a server in Amazon’s cloud. Even better, you can pre-pay, which would bring your cost down to less than $300 per year.</p>
        <p>(Specifically, we recommend a [“small” instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#on-demand) on Amazon’s EC2. If you reserve your server, we recommend the [heavy-utilization small instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#heavyUtilizationRI). PANDA is packaged as an AMI, so it’s just a couple of clicks to fire one up.)</p>
        <h2>Do it yourself</h2>
        <p>You can run PANDA on any server — in the cloud, your data center, or under your desk. It’s pretty easy to set up if that’s your thing.</p>
        <p>See the PANDA administrator documentation for specific details on how to set up a PANDA on Amazon (easy!) or on your own server (show off!). http://panda.readthedocs.org/en/latest/production.html</p>
