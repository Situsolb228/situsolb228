title: Sorting PANDA data
---

### The Problem

PANDA does not support sorting data via its web interface.

Due to technical limitations of the way data is stored in PANDA, it is not currently possible to sort the data. This a trade-off made for having fast search.

### The Solution

In order to sort your data you should use PANDA's export feature and then sort the exported data in your spreadsheet application.

To export your dataset from PANDA visit its dataset page and select **Export to CSV** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

You can also export search results from any results page using the **Export search results to CSV** button. Be aware that cross-dataset searches will produce a zip file of CSVs, rather than a single file.

Depending on the size of your dataset it may take some time to export. If your PANDA has email enabled you will receive an email when the export is complete. You will also receive a new notification in the Notifications dropdown at the top of your PANDA. Click this notification (or the link in your email) to download the exported file.

You can open this CSV file for sorting in the spreadsheet application of your choice. If you are using [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), you will find the **Sort** option in the **Data** menu.
