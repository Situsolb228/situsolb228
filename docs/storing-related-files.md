title: Storing related files
---

### The Problem

You have uploaded a dataset, but also have a Freedom of Information Act request or other documentation that you want to store with it.

Related files frequently serve as documentation of how a dataset should be interpreted or are vital context to its acquisition. It is essential that this data be readily available to other journalists who wish to report on the data.

### The Solution

Use PANDA's Related Files feature to store other files right alongside the data.

You will find the Related Files section on the right-hand side of any dataset page, just below Related Links:

![Related Files](/images/panda-related-files.png)

The three icons to the right of each file allow you to see metadata about the file, change its name and delete it, respectively.

**Note:** As a best practice, you should also upload original data files as related files whenever you manipulate the data prior to import into PANDA.
